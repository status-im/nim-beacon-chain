# Keep Nimbus updated

Make sure you stay on the lookout for any critical updates to Nimbus. This best way to do so is through the **announcements** channel on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/XRxWahP). The Nimbus eth2 releases page can be found [here](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/releases/).

> **Note:** If your beacon node is already running, you'll need to disconnect and reconnect for the changes to take effect.

To update to the latest version, either download the binary or compile the beacon node release.

> **Tip:** To check which version of Nimbus you're currently running, run `build/nimbus_beacon_node --version`

## Download the binary

Open the latest [Nimbus eth2 release](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/releases/latest) and copy the link for the file that works on your system.

```
wget <insert download link here>
tar -xzf nimbus-eth2_Linux_arm64v8*.tar.gz -C nimbus-eth2
rm nimbus-eth2_Linux_arm64v8*.tar.gz
```

## Compile the beacon node release

> ⚠️   In order to minimise downtime, we recommend updating and rebuilding the beacon node before restarting.

```
git pull && make update
```

Followed by:

```
make nimbus_beacon_node
```

to [rebuild the beacon node](./build.md).

## Urgency guidelines
As of `v1.4.0`, releases are marked with the following tags:

`low-urgency`: update at your own convenience, sometime within our normal update cycle of two weeks

`medium-urgency`: may contain an important stability fix, it is better to update sooner rather than later

`high-urgency`: update as soon as you can, this is a critical update required for Nimbus to function correctly
