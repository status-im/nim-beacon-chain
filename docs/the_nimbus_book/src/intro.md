## Introduction

### What's the Beacon Chain?

You can find a complete introduction to the beacon chain in our [Ethereum 2.0 blog series](https://our.status.im/two-point-oh-the-beacon-chain/).

In short, the beacon chain is the brain underpinning eth2 -- the next generation of Ethereum. It contains all of the machinery behind eth2's consensus.


### Why eth2?

Eth2 is a multi-year plan to improve the scalability, security, and programmability of Ethereum, without compromising on decentralisation.

In contrast to the Ethereum chain, as it currently stands, eth2 uses proof-of-stake (PoS) to secure its network. And while Ethereum as you know and love it will continue to exist as its own independent proof-of-work chain for a little while to come, the transition towards PoS starts now.

In traditional PoW, block proposers are called **_miners_**, whereas in PoS, they are called **_validators_**. In essence, _miners_ rely on actual hardware (such as some specifically manufactured mining machines), while _validators_ rely on software (such as Nimbus) and a good network connection.

### Why Nimbus?

In a sentence, Nimbus aims to be an ethereum client for resource-restricted devices. You can use Nimbus to run a validator on eth2.

It is open sourced at [github.com/status-im/nimbus](github.com/status-im/nimbus). Development progress and updates can be viewed on the [Nimbus blog](https://our.status.im/tag/nimbus/).
