# The Nimbus beacon chain book

The Nimbus beacon chain is a research implementation of the Beacon Chain â€“ the core system level chain at the heart of Ethereum 2.0.

## Introduction

### What's the Beacon Chain?

The beacon chain is the brain underpinning eth2 -- the next generation of Ethereum. It contains all of the machinery behind eth2's consensus.

You can find a complete introduction to the beacon chain in our [Ethereum 2.0 blog series](https://our.status.im/two-point-oh-the-beacon-chain/).



### Why eth2?

Eth2 is a multi-year plan to improve the scalability, security, and programmability of Ethereum, without compromising on decentralisation.

In contrast to the Ethereum chain, as it currently stands, eth2 uses proof-of-stake (PoS) to secure its network. And while Ethereum as you know and love it will continue to exist as its own independent proof-of-work chain for a little while to come, the transition towards PoS starts now.

In traditional PoW, block proposers are called **_miners_**, whereas in PoS, they are called **_validators_**. In essence, _miners_ rely on actual hardware (such as some specifically manufactured mining machines), while _validators_ rely on software (such as Nimbus) and a good network connection.

### Why Nimbus?

In a sentence, Nimbus aims to be an ethereum client for resource-restricted devices. 

Because we believe that the largest deployment of Ethereum will be on embedded systems, Nimbus is being designed to perform well on IoT and personal mobile devices, including older smartphones with resource-restricted hardware.

Although Nimbus will support full and archival nodes, its main implementation will be as a light client, with a focus on Proof of Stake and sharding.

All our code is open source; we encourage you to keep track of our activity on [github.com/status-im/nimbus](github.com/status-im/nimbus)) and keep up to date with our progress through the [Nimbus blog](https://our.status.im/tag/nimbus/).
