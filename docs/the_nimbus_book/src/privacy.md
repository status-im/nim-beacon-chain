# Increase privacy

[Do not take your validator privacy lightly](https://our.status.im/validator-privacy-call-to-action/).

## Use a VPN

You should be able to stake behind a VPN without any major issues.

You may experience some skipped actions from time to time (since validators are sensitive to both latency and bandwidth), but this is perhaps [a small price to pay](https://www.coincenter.org/the-unintended-consequences-of-the-stable-act/) to avoid leaking your IP address.

> **Note:** With a VPN, the biggest challenge is incoming peer requests, but even that isn't a show stopper. You should be able to find plenty of peers to make outbound connections to.

### Incoming peer requestions

If you want to both use a VPN and allow incoming peer requests your best bet is to use a VPN that sells dedicated IPs.

If you don't want to pay for a dedicated IP, some VPNs also offer port forwarding in certain regions. In this case, you can connect to a region that supports port forwarding and set up some automation to ensure your beacon node peers over that port.
