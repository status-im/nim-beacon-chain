# Increase privacy

[Do not take your validator privacy lightly](https://our.status.im/validator-privacy-call-to-action/).

## Use a VPN

You should be able to stake behind a VPN without any major issues.

You may experience some skipped actions from time to time (since validators are sensitive to both latency and bandwidth), but this is perhaps [a small price to pay](https://www.coincenter.org/the-unintended-consequences-of-the-stable-act/) to avoid leaking your IP address.

We recommend [protonmail](https://protonmail.com/).

## Deposit using Tornado Cash
