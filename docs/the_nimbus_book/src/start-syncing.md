# Start syncing

> **Note:** If you're planning on making a mainnet [deposit](./deposit.md) you can safely skip this step.

If you're joining a network that has already launched, you need to ensure that your beacon node is [completely synced](./keep-an-eye.md#keep-track-of-your-syncing-progress) before submitting your deposit.

This is particularly important if you are joining a network that's been running for a while.


To start syncing `medalla` , from the `nimbus-eth2` repository, run:

```
make medalla
```
