## Introduction
This page will take you through how to use your laptop to program your Raspberry Pi, get Nimbus running, and connect to the **Medalla testnet** (if this is not something you plan on doing, feel free to [skip ahead](./keep-an-eye.md)).

One of the most important aspects of the Raspberry Pi experience is trying to make it as easy as possible to get started. As such, we try our best to explain things from first-principles.

## Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM option)
- 64GB microSD Card
- microSD USB adapter
- 5V 3A USB-C charger
- Reliable Wifi connection
- Laptop
- Basic understanding of the [command line](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics)

### 1. Download Raspberry Pi Imager

[Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/) is a new imaging utility that makes it simple to manage your microSD card with Raspbian (the free Pi operating system based on Debian).

You can find the [download](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics) link for your operating system here: [Windows](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_1.4.exe), [macOS](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_1.4.dmg), [Ubuntu](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_1.4_amd64.deb).


### 2. Plug in SD card
Use your microSD to USB adapter to plug the SD card into your computer.


### 3. Download Raspberry Pi OS

Open Raspberry Pi Imager and click on **CHOOSE OS**

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/ethereum-hackmd/upload_160208a5bc983165c2a1eb9bffed01c2.png)

Make a cup of coffee :)


### 5. Set up wireless LAN

Since you have loaded Raspberry Pi OS onto a blank SD card, you will have two partitions. The first one, which is the smaller one, is the `boot` partition.

Create a `wpa_supplicant` configuration file in the `boot` partition with the following content:

```
# wpa_supplicant.conf

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>

network={
    ssid="<Insert your Wifi network's name here>"
    psk="<Insert your Wifi network's password here>"
}
```


 > **Note:** Don't forget to replace the placeholder `country`, `ssid`, and `psk` values. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) for a list of 2 letter `ISO 3166-1` country codes.



### 6. Enable SSH (using Linux or macOS)

You can [access the command line](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) of a Raspberry Pi remotely from another computer or device on the same network using [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh_(Secure_Shell)).

While SSH is not enabled by default, you can enable it by placing a file named `ssh`, without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card.

When the Pi boots, it will look for the `ssh` file. If it is found, SSH is enabled and the file is deleted. The content of the file does not matter; it can contain text, or nothing at all.

To create an empty `ssh` file, from the home directory of the `boot` partition file, run:

```
touch ssh
```

### 7. Find your Pi's IP address

Since Raspberry Pi OS supports [Multicast_DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS) out of the box, you can reach your Raspberry Pi by using its hostname and the `.local` suffix.

The default hostname on a fresh Raspberry Pi OS install is `raspberrypi`, so any Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS should respond to:


```
ping raspberrypi.local
```

The output should look more or less as follows:

```
PING raspberrypi.local (195.177.101.93): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 195.177.101.93: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=13.272 ms
64 bytes from 195.177.101.93: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=16.773 ms
64 bytes from 195.177.101.93: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=10.828 ms
...
```

Keep note of your Pi's IP address. In the above case, that's `195.177.101.93`


### 8. SSH (using Linux or macOS)

Connect to your Pi by running:

```
ssh pi@195.177.101.93
```

You'll be prompted to enter a password:
```
pi@195.177.101.93's password:
```

Enter the Pi's default password: `raspberry`

You should see a message that looks like the following:
```
Linux raspberrypi 5.4.51-v7l+ #1333 SMP Mon Aug 10 16:51:40 BST 2020 armv7l

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.

SSH is enabled and the default password for the 'pi' user has not been changed.
This is a security risk - please login as the 'pi' user and type 'passwd' to set a new password.
```

Followed by a command-line prompt indicating a successful connection:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $
```

### 9. Increase swap size to 2GB

The first step is to increase the [swap size](https://itsfoss.com/swap-size/) to 2GB (2048MB).

> **Note:** Swap acts as a breather to your system when the RAM is exhausted. When the RAM is exhausted, your Linux system uses part of the hard disk memory and allocates it to the running application.

Use the Pi's built-in text editor [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html) to open up the swap file:

```
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
```



Change the value assigned to `CONF_SWAPSIZE` from `100` to `2048`:

```
...

# set size to absolute value, leaving empty (default) then uses computed value
#   you most likely don't want this, unless you have an special disk situation
CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048

...

```


Save (`Ctrl+S`) and exit (`Ctrl+X`).

### 10. Reboot
Reboot your Pi to have the above changes take effect:

```
sudo reboot
```

This will cause your connection to close. So you'll need to `ssh` into your Pi again:

```
ssh pi@195.177.101.93
```

> **Note:** Remember to replace `195.177.101.93` with the IP address of your Pi.

### 11. Install Nimbus dependencies

You'll need to install some packages (`git`, `libgflags-dev`, `libsnappy-dev`, and `libpcre3-dev`) in order for Nimbus to run correctly.

To do so, run:
```
sudo apt-get install git libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev libpcre3-dev

```
### 12. Install Screen

`screen` is a tool that lets you safely detach from the SSH session without exiting the remote job. In other words `screen` allows the commands you run on your Pi from your laptop to keep running after you've logged out.

Run the following command to install `screen`:
```
sudo apt-get install screen
```





### 13. Clone the Nimbus repository

Run the following command to clone the [nimbus-eth2 repository](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2):

```
git clone https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2
```



### 14. Build the beacon node

Change into the directory and build the beacon node.
```
cd nimbus-eth2
make beacon_node
```

*Patience... this may take a few minutes.*

### 15. Copy signing key over to Pi

>**Note:** If you haven't generated your validator key(s) and/or made your deposit yet, follow the instructions on [this page](./deposit.md) before carrying on.

We'll use the `scp` command to send files over SSH. It allows you to copy files between computers, say from your Raspberry Pi to your desktop/laptop, or vice-versa.

Copy the folder containing your validator key(s) from your computer to your `pi`'s homefolder by opening up a new terminal window and running the following command:

```
scp -r <VALIDATOR_KEYS_DIRECTORY> pi@195.177.101.93:
```

> **Note:** Don't forget the colon (:) at the end of the command!

As usual, replace `195.177.101.93` with your Pi's IP address, and `<VALIDATOR_KEYS_DIRECTORY>` with the full pathname of your `validator_keys` directory (if you used the Launchpad [command line app](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases/) this would have been created for you when you generated your keys).


 > **Tip:** run `pwd` in your `validator_keys` directory to print the full pathname to the console.



### 16. Import signing key into Nimbus

To import your signing key into Nimbus, from the `nimbus-eth2` directory run:

```
build/beacon_node deposits import  --data-dir=build/data/shared_medalla_0 ../validator_keys
```



 You'll be asked to enter the password you created to encrypt your keystore(s). Don't worry, this is entirely normal. Your validator client needs both your signing keystore(s) and the password encrypting it to import your [key](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/05/21/keys/) (since it needs to decrypt the keystore in order to be able to use it to sign on your behalf).

### 17. Run Screen

From the `nimbus-eth2` directory, run:
```
screen
```

You should see output that looks like the following:
```

Press `Enter` or `Space`.

### 18. Connect to medalla

We're finally ready to connect to medalla!

>**Note:** If you haven't already, we recommend registering for, and running, your own Infura endpoint to connect to eth1. For instruction on how to do so, see [this page](./infura-guide.md).

To connect to medalla, run:
```
make NODE_PARAMS="--web3-url=wss://goerli.infura.io/ws/v3/ae1e57122a1e49af8e835e82a5e35e60" medalla
```

Be sure to replace the `web3-url` above with your own websocket (`wss`) Infura endpoint.[^1]

### 19. Check for successful connection

If you look near the top of the logs printed to your console, you should see confirmation that your beacon node has started, with your local validator attached:

```
INF 2020-10-07 17:04:09.213+02:00 Initializing networking                    topics="networking" tid=11688398 file=eth2_network.nim:1335 hostAddress=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9000 network_public_key=0802122102defb020c8e47dd8f5da89f51ed6c3998aaa0dd59eeb2784e29d47fdbdab69235 announcedAddresses=@[/ip4/195.177.101.93/tcp/9000]

```

To keep track of your syncing progress, have a look at the output at the very bottom of the terminal window in which your validator is running. You should see something like:

```
peers: 35 ‚ùØ finalized: ada7228a:8765 ‚ùØ head: b2fe11cd:8767:2 ‚ùØ time: 9900:7 (316807) ‚ùØ sync: wPwwwwwDwwDPwPPPwwww:7:4.0627 (280512)
```

Keep an eye on the number of peers your currently connected to (in the above case that's `35`), as well as your [sync progress](./keep-an-eye.md#syncing-progress).

### 20. End ssh session and logout

To detach your `screen` session but leave your processes running, press `Ctrl-A` followed by `Ctrl-D`. You can now exit your `ssh` session (`Ctrl-C`) and switch off your laptop.

Verifying your progress is as simple as `ssh`ing back into your Pi and typing `screen -r`. This will resume your screen session (and you will be able to see your node's entire output since you logged out).

-------

[^1]: If you were to just run `make medalla`, the beacon node would launch with an Infura endpoint supplied by us. This endpoint is passed through the `web3-url` option (which takes as input the url of the web3 server from which you'd like to observe the eth1 chain). Because Infura caps the requests per endpoint per day to 100k, and all Nimbus nodes use the same Infura endpoint by default, it can happen that our Infura endpoint is overloaded (i.e the requests on a given day reach the 100k limit). If this happens, all requests to Infura using the default endpoint will fail, which means your node will stop processing new deposits.
  To pass in your own Infura endpoint, you'll need to run:
	```
	make NODE_PARAMS="--web3-url=<YOUR_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT>" medalla
	```
	Importantly, the endpoint must be a websocket (`wss`) endpoint, not `https`. If you're not familiar with Infura, we recommend reading through our [Infura guide](./infura-guide), first. **P.S.** We are well aware that Infura is less than ideal from a decentralisation perspective. As such we are in the process of changing our default to [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth) (with Infura as a fallback). For some rough notes on how to use Geth with Nimbus, see [here](https://gist.github.com/onqtam/aaf883d46f4dab1311ca9c160df12fe4) (we will be adding more complete instructions very soon).
