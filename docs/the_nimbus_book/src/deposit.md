# Make a deposit
 
The easiest way to get your deposit in is to follow the Ethereum Foundation's launchpad instructions here:
 
[https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/](https://zinken.launchpad.ethereum.org/)
 
You may notice that there have been considerable improvements to the launchpad process since the summer.
 
In particular, the Key Generation section is now much clearer, and you no longer have to install dependencies to get the command line app working.

We won't elaborate on each individual step here, since they are well explained on the site itself. However, there are two points of note:

## 1. Eth1 connection

In the `Select Client` section...

Scroll to the bottom and click `Continue`.

## 2. Block explorer
Once you've sent off your transaction, you should see the following screen.

We recommend you click on `Beaconchain`. This will open up a window that allows you to keep track of your validator's status.

## A note on expected waiting time (the queue)
Once you send off your transaction(s), your validator will be put in a queue based on deposit time, and will getting through the queue may take a few hours or days (assuming the chain is finalising).
