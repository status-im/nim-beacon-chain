# Make a deposit
 
The easiest way to get your deposit in is to follow the Ethereum Foundation's launchpad instructions here:
 
[https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/](https://zinken.launchpad.ethereum.org/)
 
You may notice that there have been considerable improvements to the launchpad process since the summer.
 
In particular, the Key Generation section is now much clearer, and you no longer have to install dependencies to get the command line app working.

## A note on expected waiting time (the queue)
Once you send off your transaction(s), your validator will be put in a queue based on deposit time, and will getting through the queue may take a few hours or days (assuming the chain is finalising).
