# This Docker image can change from one build to another, because the upstream
# Debian package index is continuously updated and we have to run `apt-get
# update` in here.
#
# The only way to make this a part of our reproducible build system is to build
# it once, upload it to Docker Hub and make sure it's being pulled regularly so
# it's not deleted after 6 months of inactivity.
