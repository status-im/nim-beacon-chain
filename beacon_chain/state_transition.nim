# State transition, as described in
# https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#beacon-chain-state-transition-function
#
# The purpose of this code right is primarily educational, to help piece
# together the mechanics of the beacon state and to discover potential problem
# areas. The entry point is `state_transition` which is at the bottom of the file!
#
# General notes about the code (TODO):
# * Weird styling - the sections taken from the spec use python styling while
#   the others use NEP-1 - helps grepping identifiers in spec
# * We mix procedural and functional styles for no good reason, except that the
#   spec does so also.
# * For indices, we get a mix of uint64, ValidatorIndex and int - this is currently
#   swept under the rug with casts
# * Sane error handling is missing in most cases (yay, we'll get the chance to
#   debate exceptions again!)
# When updating the code, add TODO sections to mark where there are clear
# improvements to be made - other than that, keep things similar to spec for
# now.

    # already because withdrawable_epoch has passed, which more precisely has
    # intuitive meaning of all-the-current-relevant-validators. So, check for
    # not-(either (not-even-pending) or withdrawn). That is validators change
    # from not-even-pending to pending to active to exited to withdrawable to
    # withdrawn, and this avoids bugs on potential edge cases and off-by-1's.
