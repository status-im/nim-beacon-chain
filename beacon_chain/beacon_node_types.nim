  # Per Danny as of 2018-12-21:
  # Yeah, you can do any linear combination of signatures. but you have to
  # remember the linear combination of pubkeys that constructed
  # if you have two instances of a signature from pubkey p, then you need 2*p
  # in the group pubkey because the attestation bitlist is only 1 bit per
  # pubkey right now, attestations do not support this it could be extended to
  # support N overlaps up to N times per pubkey if we had N bits per validator
  # instead of 1
  # We are shying away from this for the time being. If there end up being
  # substantial difficulties in network layer aggregation, then adding bits to
  # aid in supporting overlaps is one potential solution

  BlockPool* = ref object
    ## Pool of blocks responsible for keeping a graph of resolved blocks as well
    ## as candidates that may yet become part of that graph.
    ## Currently, this type works as a facade to the BeaconChainDB, making
    ## assumptions about the block composition therein.
    ##
    ## The general idea here is that blocks known to us are divided into two
    ## camps - unresolved and resolved. When we start the chain, we have a
    ## genesis state that serves as the root of the graph we're interested in.
    ## Every block that belongs to that chain will have a path to that block -
    ## conversely, blocks that do not are not interesting to us.
    ##
    ## As the chain progresses, some states become finalized as part of the
    ## consensus process. One way to think of that is that the blocks that
    ## come before them are no longer relevant, and the finalized state
    ## is the new genesis from which we build. Thus, instead of tracing a path
    ## to genesis, we can trace a path to any finalized block that follows - we
    ## call the oldest such block a tail block.
    ##
    ## It's important to note that blocks may arrive in any order due to
    ## chainging network conditions - we counter this by buffering unresolved
    ## blocks for some time while trying to establish a path.
    ##
    ## Once a path is established, the block becomes resolved. We store the
    ## graph in memory, in the form of BlockRef objects. This is also when
    ## we forward the block for storage in the database
    ##
    ## TODO evaluate the split of responsibilities between the two
    ## TODO prune the graph as tail moves

    pending*: Table[Eth2Digest, SignedBeaconBlock] ##\
