  # Per Danny as of 2018-12-21:
  # Yeah, you can do any linear combination of signatures. but you have to
  # remember the linear combination of pubkeys that constructed
  # if you have two instances of a signature from pubkey p, then you need 2*p
  # in the group pubkey because the attestation bitlist is only 1 bit per
  # pubkey right now, attestations do not support this it could be extended to
  # support N overlaps up to N times per pubkey if we had N bits per validator
  # instead of 1
  # We are shying away from this for the time being. If there end up being
  # substantial difficulties in network layer aggregation, then adding bits to
  # aid in supporting overlaps is one potential solution
