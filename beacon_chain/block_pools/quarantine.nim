  # Typically, blocks will arrive in mostly topological order, with some
  # out-of-order block pairs. Therefore, it is unhelpful to use either a
  # FIFO or LIFO discpline, and since by definition each block gets used
  # either 0 or 1 times it's not a cache either. Instead, stop accepting
  # new blocks, and rely on syncing to cache up again if necessary. When
  # using forward sync, blocks only arrive in an order not requiring the
  # quarantine.
  #
  # For typical use cases, this need not be large, as they're two or three
  # blocks arriving out of order due to variable network delays. As blocks
  # for future slots are rejected before reaching quarantine, this usually
  # will be a block for the last couple of slots for which the parent is a
  # likely imminent arrival.
