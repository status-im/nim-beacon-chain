# State transition, as described in
# https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#beacon-chain-state-transition-function
#
# The entry point is `state_transition` which is at the bottom of the file!
#
# General notes about the code:
# * Weird styling - the sections taken from the spec use python styling while
#   the others use NEP-1 - helps grepping identifiers in spec
# * When updating the code, add TODO sections to mark where there are clear
#   improvements to be made - other than that, keep things similar to spec unless
#   motivated by security or performance considerations
#
# Performance notes:
# * The state transition is used in two contexts: to verify that incoming blocks
#   are correct and to replay existing blocks from database. Incoming blocks
#   are processed one-by-one while replay happens multiple blocks at a time.
# * Although signature verification is the slowest operation in the state
#   state transition, we skip it during replay - this is also when we repeatedly
#   call the state transition, making the non-signature part of the code
#   important from a performance point of view.
# * It's important to start with a prefilled cache - generating the shuffled
#   list of active validators is generally very slow.
# * Throughout, the code is affected by inefficient for loop codegen, meaning
#   that we have to iterate over indices and pick out the value manually:
#   https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/14421
# * Throughout, we're affected by inefficient `let` borrowing, meaning we
#   often have to take the address of a sequence item due to the above - look
#   for `let ... = unsafeAddr sequence[idx]`
# * Throughout, we're affected by the overloading rules that prefer a `var`
#   overload to a non-var overload - look for `asSeq()` - when the `var`
#   overload is used, the hash tree cache is cleared, which, aside from being
#   slow itself, causes additional processing to recalculate the merkle tree.
