# This file contains data types that are part of the spec and thus subject to

# The spec folder in general contains code that has been hoisted from the
# specification and that follows the spec as closely as possible, so as to make
# it easy to keep up-to-date.
#
# These datatypes are used as specifications for serialization - thus should not
# be altered outside of what the spec says. Likewise, they should not be made
# `ref` - this can be achieved by wrapping them in higher-level
# types / composition

# TODO Careful, not nil analysis is broken / incomplete and the semantics will
#      likely change in future versions of the language:
