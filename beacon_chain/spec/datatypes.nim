# These datatypes are used as specifications for serialization - thus should not
# be altered outside of what the spec says. Likewise, they should not be made

    # Future:
    #   IntSets stores the first 34 elements in an array[34, int] instead of a bitfield
    #   to avoid heap allocation in profiled common cases.
    #
    #   In Ethereum we probably always have over 34 attesters given the goal of decentralization.
    #   Allocating 8 * 34 = 272 bytes on the stack is wasteful, when this can be packed in just 8 bytes
    #   with room to spare.
    #
    #   Also, IntSets uses machine int size while we require int64 even on 32-bit platform.
