# This file contains data types that are part of the spec and thus subject to
# serialization and spec updates.
#
# The spec folder in general contains code that has been hoisted from the
# specification and that follows the spec as closely as possible, so as to make
# it easy to keep up-to-date.
#
# The latest version can be seen here:
# https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/beacon-chain.md
#
# How wrong the code is:
# https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/compare/8116562049ed80ad1823dd62e98a7483ddf1546c...master
#
# These datatypes are used as specifications for serialization - thus should not
# be altered outside of what the spec says. Likewise, they should not be made
# `ref` - this can be achieved by wrapping them in higher-level
# types / composition

# TODO Data types:
# Presently, we're reusing the data types from the serialization (uint64) in the
# objects we pass around to the beacon chain logic, thus keeping the two
# similar. This is convenient for keeping up with the specification, but
# will eventually need a more robust approach such that we don't run into
# over- and underflows.
# Some of the open questions are being tracked here:
# https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/224
#
# The present approach causes some problems due to how Nim treats unsigned
# integers - here's no high(uint64), arithmetic support is incomplete, there's
# no over/underflow checking available
#
# Eventually, we could also differentiate between user/tainted data and
# internal state that's gone through sanity checks already.
