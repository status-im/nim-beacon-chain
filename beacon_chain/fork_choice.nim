#
#   The beacon chain fork choice rule is a hybrid that combines justification and finality with Latest Message Driven (LMD) Greediest Heaviest Observed SubTree (GHOST). At any point in time a [validator](#dfn-validator) `v` subjectively calculates the beacon chain head as follows.
#
#      * Let `store` be the set of attestations and blocks
#        that the validator `v` has observed and verified
#        (in particular, block ancestors must be recursively verified).
#        Attestations not part of any chain are still included in `store`.
#      * Let `finalized_head` be the finalized block with the highest slot number.
#        (A block `B` is finalized if there is a descendant of `B` in `store`
#        the processing of which sets `B` as finalized.)
#      * Let `justified_head` be the descendant of `finalized_head`
#        with the highest slot number that has been justified
#        for at least `EPOCH_LENGTH` slots.
#        (A block `B` is justified if there is a descendant of `B` in `store`
#        the processing of which sets `B` as justified.)
#        If no such descendant exists set `justified_head` to `finalized_head`.
#      * Let `get_ancestor(store, block, slot)` be the ancestor of `block` with slot number `slot`.
#        The `get_ancestor` function can be defined recursively
#
#        def get_ancestor(store, block, slot):
#            return block if block.slot == slot
#                         else get_ancestor(store, store.get_parent(block), slot)`.
#
#      * Let `get_latest_attestation(store, validator)`
#        be the attestation with the highest slot number in `store` from `validator`.
#        If several such attestations exist,
#        use the one the validator `v` observed first.
#      * Let `get_latest_attestation_target(store, validator)`
#        be the target block in the attestation `get_latest_attestation(store, validator)`.
#      * The head is `lmd_ghost(store, justified_head)`. (See specs)
#
# Departing from specs:
#   - We use a simple fork choice rule without finalized and justified head
#   - We don't implement "get_latest_attestation(store, validator) -> Attestation"
#     nor get_latest_attestation_target
#   - We use block hashes (Eth2Digest) instead of raw blocks where possible
